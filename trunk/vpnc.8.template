.SH NAME
vpnc \- client for Cisco VPN3000 Concentrator, IOS and PIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vpnc
[\fI--version\fR] [\fI--print-config\fR] [\fI--help\fR] [\fI--long-help\fR] [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIconfig files\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the
\fBvpnc\fR and
\fBvpnc\-disconnect\fR commands.
.PP
\fBvpnc\fR is a
VPN client for the Cisco 3000 VPN  Concentrator,  creating  a IPSec-like
connection as a tunneling network device for the local system. It uses
the TUN/TAP driver in  Linux  kernel  2.4  and  above  and device tun(4)
on BSD. The created connection is presented as a tunneling network
device to the local system.
.PP
OBLIGATORY WARNING: the most used configuration (XAUTH authentication
with pre-shared keys and password authentication) is insecure by design,
be aware of this fact when you use vpnc to exchange sensitive data like
passwords!
.PP
The vpnc daemon by itself does not set any routes, but it calls
\fBvpnc\-script\fR to do this job. \fBvpnc\-script\fR displays
a connect banner. If the concentrator supplies a network list
for split-tunneling these networks are added to the routing table.
Otherwise the default-route will be modified to point to the tunnel.
Further a host route to the concentrator is added in the later case.
If the client host needs DHCP, care must be taken to add another
host route to the DHCP-Server around the tunnel.
.PP
The \fBvpnc\-disconnect\fR command is used to terminate
the connection previously created by \fBvpnc\fR
and restore the previous routing configuration.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The daemon reads configuration data from the following places:
.PD 0
.IP \(bu
command line options
.IP \(bu
config file(s) specified on the command line
.IP \(bu
/etc/vpnc/default.conf
.IP \(bu
/etc/vpnc.conf
.IP \(bu
prompting the user if not found above

.PP

vpnc can parse options and
.B configuration files
in any order. However the first
place to set an option wins.
configuration filenames
which do not contain a /
will be searched at
.B /etc/vpnc/<filename>
and
.B /etc/vpnc/<filename>.conf.
Otherwise
.B <filename>
and
.B <filename>.conf
will be used.
If no configuration file
is specified on the command-line
at all, both
.B /etc/vpnc/default.conf
and
.B /etc/vpnc.conf
will be loaded.

.SH OPTIONS
The program options can be either given as arguments (but not all of them
for security reasons) or be stored in a configuration file.
.PD 0
.\" ###makeman.pl: Insert options from help-output here!

.HP
\fB\-\-print\-config\fR
.IP
Prints your configuration; output can be used as vpnc.conf

.SH FILES
.I /etc/vpnc.conf
.I /etc/vpnc/default.conf
.RS
The default configuration file. You can specify the same config
directives as with command line options and additionaly
.B IPSec secret
and
.B Xauth password
both supplying a cleartext password. Scrambled passwords from the Cisco
configuration profiles can be used with
.B IPSec obfuscated secret
and
.B Xauth obfuscated password.

See
.BR EXAMPLES
for further details.
.RE

.I /etc/vpnc/*.conf
.RS
vpnc will read configuration files in this directory when
the config filename (with or without .conf) is specified on the command line.
.RE


.SH EXAMPLES
This is an example vpnc.conf with pre-shared keys:

.RS
.PD 0
IPSec gateway vpn.example.com
.P
IPSec ID ExampleVpnPSK
.P
IKE Authmode psk
.P
IPSec secret PskS3cret!
.P
Xauth username user@example.com
.P
Xauth password USecr3t
.PD
.RE

And another one with hybrid authentication (requires that vpnc was
built with openssl support):

.RS
.PD 0
IPSec gateway vpn.example.com
.P
IPSec ID ExampleVpnHybrid
.P
IKE Authmode hybrid
.P

.P
CA-Dir /etc/vpnc
.P
\fBor\fR
.P
CA-File /etc/vpnc/vpn-example-com.pem
.P

.P
IPSec secret HybS3cret?
.P
Xauth username user@example.com
.P
Xauth password 123456
.PD
.RE

The lines begin with a keyword (no leading spaces!).
The values start exactly one space after the keywords, and run to the end of
line. This lets you put any kind of weird character (except CR, LF and NUL) in
your strings, but it does mean you can't add comments after a string, or spaces
before them.

In case the the \fBCA-Dir\fR option is used, your certificate needs to be
named something like 722d15bd.X, where X is a manually assigned number to
make sure that files with colliding hashes have different names. The number
can be derived from the certificate file itself:
.P
openssl x509 -subject_hash -noout -in /etc/vpnc/vpn-example-com.pem

See also the
.B \-\-print\-config
option to generate a config file, and the example file in the package
documentation directory where more advanced usage is demonstrated.

Advanced features like manual setting of multiple target routes and
disabling /etc/resolv.conf rewriting is documented in the README of the
vpnc package.

.SH TODO
.PD 0
Certificate support (Pre-Shared-Key + XAUTH is known to be insecure).
.P
Further points can be found in the TODO file.
