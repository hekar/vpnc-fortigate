TODO list

* clean up scripts
  - config-support for vpnc-script
  - customizable handling of routing
  - switch to disable resolv.conf rewriting
  - do $something with split_dns

* beautify paket dump output

* large code cleanup
  - at least one function per packet (instead of one function per phase)
  - factor out a central select-loop, send / receive code, nat-t handling
  - maybe even add some sort of state machine
  - get a rid of remaining (non-const) global variables

* implement phase1 rekeying (with or without xauth-reauthentication)
* implement compression
* try a list of gateways (backup server)
* Generate the manpage command line part directly from vpnc

* optionally use in-kernel-ipsec with pf-key
  - merge patch

* add support for pcap and dump decrypted traffic

* research:
  - usernames containing "@" unable to login
  - ipsec over tcp
  - nortel support?
  - segfault if > 100 routes/acls (to large paket? read size?)
  - amd64 somehow broken? maybe gcc bugs??

* optional drop root (rekey? reconnect? vpnc-script calls?)
* implement certificate support
* Adapt lifetime (when given as time) to certificate lifetime etc
  (rfc2401, 4.4.3)
* implement main mode for phase 1 (needed to *use* certificates in
  many cases)

* factor out crypto stuff (cipher, hmac, dh)
  - http://libtomcrypt.org/features.html
  - http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/ patch fertig
  - libgcrypt (old too?)
  - autodetect?
  - openssl??
  - relicense to gpl+ssl?

* links to packages, howtos, etc.
  - kvpnc http://home.gna.org/kvpnc/
