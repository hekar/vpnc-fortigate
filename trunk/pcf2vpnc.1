.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This script accompanies \fBvpnc\fR. It attempts to
convert *.pcf\-configuration files often spread with proprietary
(read Cisco) VPN\-clients into vpnc\-configuration files,
usually named \fB*.conf\fR.

If [\fIvpnc file\fR] is not specified, the result will be
printed to STDOUT. If specified, it will be written to that
file. Please make sure that it has apropriate permissions as
it may contain sensitive data!
