[vpnc-devel] vpnc with Nortel Contivity

I've managed to get vpnc working with a Nortel Contivity VPN
concentrator.

Basically the differences are:

* The group name and password are pre-transformed:
  key_id = SHA1(group_name)
  shared_key = HMAC_SHA1(group_name, SHA1(group_password))

* The XAUTH implementation follows
  draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-xauth-02.txt (whereas CISCO uses a
  later version).  Specifically:
  - the encoding of the proposal is not defined in that spec,
    and Nortel does it differently
  - the XAUTH attributes have different numerical values
    (which overlap with Mode-Config, argh)
  - success/failure are encoded as Mode-Config message types
    5/6 (or sometimes as an ISAKMP notify?) rather than in
    an attribute
  - the concentrator always sends 0 in XAUTH_TYPE and the
    client may have to return a different value (xauth-02 is
    not clear on whether this is allowed, it is not
    clarified until xauth-05).  In my case I'm using an
    ActivCard token for which I have to specify 5 (SecurID).

* Mode-Config is done as a push, i.e. the server sends SET,
  instead of a pull.

* The concentrator wants to be the initiator in phase 2
  quick mode, so we have to support being a responder.

Thus the changes are fairly intrusive - phase 1 is common
but XAUTH/Mode-Config/phase 2 diverge.

If people are interested, I can clean up what I've done
and send patches.

----------------
I've tried to connect to my corporate VPN, but the only message I got was:

vpnc: xauth packet unsupported: ATTRIBUTES_NOT_SUPPORTED

Problem was found in xauth_type. In my case request attribute "xauth_type" consisted 5 as value. There is quick 
fix for this issue below. But...

In the chapter 6.2 of the draft-beaulieu-ike-xauth-02.txt we can read:

"XAUTH-TYPE - The type of extended authentication requested whose
   values are described in the next section.  This is an optional
   attribute for the ISAKMP_CFG_REQUEST and ISAKMP_CFG_REPLY messages.
   If the XAUTH-TYPE is not present, then it is assumed to be Generic.
   The XAUTH-TYPE in a REPLY MUST be identical to the XAUTH-TYPE in the
   REQUEST."

So I think the better way is to send reply with the same xauth_type value as in request. But I can't test it 
because our server always use 5 and never 0.

Thanks.

------------ This ended up in the folowin patch
        if (ap->af != isakmp_attr_16 || !(ap->u.attr_16 == 0 || ap->u.attr_16 == 5))
          reject = ISAKMP_N_ATTRIBUTES_NOT_SUPPORTED;
                xauth_type_requested = ap->u.attr_16;
----------------------

This patch didn't work in my NortelVPN setup I mad a buildflag of until a proper fix can be made
so please set NORTELVPN_XAUTHTYPE_AS_REQUEST flag to vpnc.c to get this

#ifdef NORTELVPN_XAUTHTYPE_AS_REQUEST
        if (ap->af != isakmp_attr_16 || !(ap->u.attr_16 == 0 || ap->u.attr_16 == 5))
          reject = ISAKMP_N_ATTRIBUTES_NOT_SUPPORTED;
                xauth_type_requested = ap->u.attr_16;
#else

        if (ap->af != isakmp_attr_16 || ap->u.attr_16 != 0)
          reject = ISAKMP_N_ATTRIBUTES_NOT_SUPPORTED;
#endif
